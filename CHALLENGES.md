## Technical Challenges & Solutions

During the development of this assignment, I encountered and resolved the following issues:

---

### 1. `npm ci` Failure in Docker Build

| Detail       | Description                                                                                                   |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Issue**    | The Docker build failed with the error `npm ci can only install with an existing package-lock.json`.          |
| **Cause**    | My `COPY` instruction was `COPY package.json ./`, which excluded the lockfile required for deterministic builds. |
| **Solution** | Updated the Dockerfile to use `COPY package*.json ./` to include both the manifest and the lockfile.          |

### 2. Terraform Key Pair Path Error

| Detail       | Description                                                                                                                                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Issue**    | Terraform failed with `InvalidKeyPair.NotFound`.                                                                                             |
| **Cause**    | I mistakenly provided the local file path (`/Users/.../AWS-key.pem`) to the `key_name` variable. AWS requires the logical name of the key pair stored in the cloud. |
| **Solution** | Corrected the `terraform.tfvars` variable to `AWS-key`.                                                                                      |
